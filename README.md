# Date By Name Generator
 The Date-By-Name generator is a fun twist on the typical generator format as I felt just generating a name would be too boring. Here, the generator will pick a date for the couple based on their names, or send them a webpage for a great date near them is they're feeling spontaneous.

 The code for this project uses JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Goals

 Fun and easy to use were the goals. Having the users put their names in adds a touch of dynamism instead of just hitting a button - It gets the user(s) involved and invested. Dates based on their names are also a means to tie everything back to the couple (John & Mary > Jazz Clubs, Museums, etc.). The generator will also randomly generated an adjective to describe the date to feel less repetative (Breathtaking, Heavenly, Remarkable, etc.). The colors used for the background, pink and Blue, and font for the title are to keep things lighthearted and sweet.
 
## Lessons Learned

While coding this, I learned array manipulation can be tricky between langauges and checking values within them can quickly cause errors if you're not handling them with care. Even though a string is an array, getting a value isn't always as simple as String[0]. Reviewing langauge syntax is key.

I also learned that the little things matter and how to convey them with code. For example, when generating random words, a or an is important to fill in spaces so text feels natural. Giving the user feedback is also important. For example: If a name is missing from the input, a message will appear so the user knows they're using the tool incorrectly.

## Setup

 The project can be download and run easily by opening the app_date.html file. It will open in your default browser.

## Instructions

 You may input your name and the name of your date into the input fields. Once both names have been filled in, select "Plan My Date". If a name is missing, you will be asked to fill in both names. If you're satisfied with the date, you may select "Find X Dates Near Me", which will take you to a Google search results page with dates of this type in your area.

 For the spontaneous, "Surprise Us" will pick a completely random date from the entire list of dates and take advantage of Google's "I'm Feeling Lucky" feature, which takes you to a webpage for that selection (like a local aquarium or stadium).
